What's This?
============

This is an example project, which shows how to use the libmaple build
system to compile and upload your own projects.

It works with libmaple fetched from the LeafLabs GitHub repository:

How Do I Use It?
================

There are two configuration files: Makefile and rules.mk.

Look at Makefile. It's your project Makefile, which behaves like a proxy
to libmaple's Makefile. Use it as a template for starting your own project.

The following variables needs to be configured:

LIB_MAPLE_HOME - it should point to the root directory of libmaple
                 project, may be defined as relative path, say
                 '~/maple/libmaple'.  It may be a good idea to set it
                 as an environment variable instead of a Makefile
                 variable. As an environment variable, you won't need
                 to edit it in Makefile and it will be used
                 automatically.

BOARD          - board type. Use 'make list-boards' to see the list of
                 supported boards.

MEMORY_TARGET  - binary deployment type: 'flash', 'ram' or 'jtag'. See
                 'make help' for details. 

Also, custom libmaple modules may be configured with USER_MODULES
variable.  Your project is a user module and it is configured
implicitly. Libfoo is another user module defined inside of this
project. (Libfoo is an example of how you can add additional
third-party libraries to your project, if you want.)

It is important not to confuse the concept of a user module with the
concept of the source files directory. USER_MODULES is a list of
directories that the libmaple Makefile expects to contain additional
code to include in the build. Each directory in USER_MODULES must
contain a rules.mk, which describes how to compile the module. The
list of user modules configured in this project Makefile.

Each rules.mk file is a Makefile fragment that is used in libmaple's
build system. It tells libmaple's Makefile how to build your project's
sources.  Use the rules.mk in this project as templates when starting
your own project.

Use 'make clean' command to clean your project. Use 'make' (or 'make
sketch') to build your project and link it with libmaple.

How Do I Use It with Eclipse CDT?
=================================

1) perform 'git clone' for libmaple and example-libmaple-project
   repositories
2) import libmaple project with:
   File -> New -> Project -> C/C++ -> Makefile Project with Existing Code  
3) import example-libmaple-project project the same way
4) right click on example-libmaple-project project, open:
   Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Behaviour tab
   and change default target name 'all' to 'sketch'
5) set LIB_MAPLE_HOME value in example-libmaple-project Makefile
6) copy main.cpp file from example-libmaple-project and paste it to the
   root of libmaple project
7) perform example-libmaple-project project clean and build

From this point you can start tweaking example-libmaple-project to
implement your own project. 

If you have unresolved symbol errors in a Problems view for your
project, then fix it as follows:

1) right click on project and go Properties -> C/C++ General -> Indexer
2) turn on 'Enable project specific settings'
3) turn on 'Index unused headers as C files'
4) turn on 'Index unused headers as C++ files'
5) if you have no LIB_MAPLE_HOME variable set so far in your environment
   then go to C/C++ Build -> Environment and set it there
6) you need to go C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols and add following
   values on Includes tab for all languages and configurations:

   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/wirish/include
   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/libmaple/include
   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/wirish/boards/<directory with your board name>/include
   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/libmaple/<directory with your cpu family code>/include

   Example directory names for board and cpu:

   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/wirish/boards/maple_RET6/include
   ${LIB_MAPLE_HOME}/libmaple/stm32f1/include

7) don't forget to save your settings with Apply or OK button

Now you can make clean and build for your project. Undefined symbol errors
should go away.

Also, you can add/use any Makefile targets to the Make Target view of
Eclipse CDT. It is located at top-right corner of workspace while using
C/C++ perspective. 

What Else?
==========

You're using the libmaple Makefile, so you can also use any of the
variables it respects. For instance, to compile for Maple Mini, use
BOARD=maple_mini in the usual way:

$ make BOARD=maple_mini

You can also use any of the libmaple Makefile targets. For example, to
"make install":

$ make install

Happy hacking!
